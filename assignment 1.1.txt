Question.1
 Say true or false for the below statements:
a.prescreptive analytics used to predict the future outcomes?
ans: False
b.Base R packages installed automatically?
ans: True

Question 2
What is recycling of elements in a vector?
answer:
While performing an arithmectic operation on any two vectors with unequal lengths ,R automatically repeats or recycles the shorter one until it is long enough to match the longer vector.
Question .3
Give an example of recycling of elements.
addition of two vectors
a=c(1,2,3,4,5,6) 
b=c(1,3)
a+b will be 2,5,4,7,6,9
as c(1,3) is a shorter vector the vector repeats itself to form c(1,3,1,3,1,3) so that it could successfully match.
